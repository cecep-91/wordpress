# Wordpress Install Automation
This is my first Bash script, so there may be bugs and some unstable commands in it.

This script is designed to automatically create a web server with just a few initial inputs. I created this script because I've installed WordPress manually so many times for class projects. I made this to make it easier for me when I need to do it again in the future.

Yes i know Bash script is not a good way to do this kind of thing. The privacy and security is worst. I'll back maybe with Ansible or something else to work around that.
